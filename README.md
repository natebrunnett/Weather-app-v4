Before downloading:
      This is an expo app made in JavaScript React Native.
      The API keys that are required for this app to fully function are:

        A Google Places API Key (Place Autocomplete *free)
        https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/autocomplete
        
        OpenWeatherAPIKey Current Weather 2.5 (This was was provided by my school and seems to be free at the moment)
        https://openweathermap.org/current

        This app is intended to be uploaded to the AppleStore, and at the moment the API keys will not be included in the repo.
